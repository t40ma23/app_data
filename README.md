Population Index Web Application

**Design:**
The Population Index Web Application is designed to provide users with easy access to historical population data of Japan, Italy, and Korea. The application utilizes Flask as the backend framework and HTML for the frontend. Python's built-in ‘sqlite3’ module is used for interacting with the SQLite database to store and retrieve population data. The data is presented in a tabular format, allowing users to view population index values for different years and countries.

**Development:**
The development process involved setting up a Flask project structure and organizing the population data into a format that can be easily accessed by the application. SQLite3 was integrated into the application to manage the database operations, including creating tables, inserting data, and querying data. Flask routes were defined to serve the data to the frontend, and HTML templates were created to render the data in a user-friendly manner.

**Implementation:**
During the implementation phase, the Flask application was developed to handle HTTP requests and serve the population data to users. Python code was used to interact with the SQLite3 database, executing SQL queries to retrieve and manipulate data. The application was tested locally to ensure functionality and responsiveness across different devices and screen sizes.

**Installation:**
To install the application, users can clone the project repository from GitHub and set up a virtual environment to install the necessary dependencies. The Flask application can then be run locally, allowing users to access the population data via their web browser.

**Deployment:**
The application was deployed on Render to make it accessible to a wider audience. Render provides a platform for deploying and managing web applications with ease. The Flask application, along with the SQLite3 database file, was configured to run on Render's infrastructure, ensuring reliable performance and scalability.

**Use:**
Upon launching the application, users are presented with a table displaying the Population Index values for Japan, Italy, and Korea for different years. They can easily navigate through the data and visualize trends over time for each country. The application provides a user-friendly interface for exploring historical population data and gaining insights into demographic patterns. Overall, the Population Index Web Application offers a valuable resource for researchers, educators, and demographics enthusiasts to analyze and understand population trends over the years for these countries.
